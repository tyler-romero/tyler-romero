### Hey there! 👋 I’m Tyler Romero (nice to meet you!)
- 🤖 I work at [Groundlight](https://www.groundlight.ai/) on a tool to allow developers to [quickly build CV applications from natural language descriptions](https://code.groundlight.ai/). Before this, I worked at Twitter on [modeling for the Home Timeline and Conversations](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm-ml/tree/main/projects/home/recap).
- 👀 I’m interested in computer vision, multimodal LLMs, recommender systems, autoML, and ML Ops.
- 🔬 Some of the best research papers I've read recently:
  * [InstructBLIP: Towards General-purpose Vision-Language Models with Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06500)
  * [QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314)
  * [On the Factory Floor: ML Engineering for Industrial-Scale Ads Recommendation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05310)
  * [Population Based Training of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09846)
