### Hey there! üëã I‚Äôm Tyler Romero (nice to meet you!)
- ü§ñ I work at [Groundlight](https://www.groundlight.ai/) on a tool to allow developers to [quickly build CV applications from natural language descriptions](https://pypi.org/project/groundlight/). Before this, I worked at Twitter on the Home Timeline and Conversations.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in recommender systems, NLP, CV, GCNs, autoML and ML Ops.
- üî¨ Some of the best research papers I've read recently:
  * [On the Factory Floor: ML Engineering for Industrial-Scale Ads Recommendation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05310)
  * [Monolith: Real Time Recommendation System with Collisionless Embedding Tables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07663.pdf)
  * [Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Web-Scale Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01973)
  * [Population Based Training of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09846)
  * [Can weight sharing outperform random architecture search?](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Bender_Can_Weight_Sharing_Outperform_Random_Architecture_Search_An_Investigation_With_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf)
- üìù My favorite industry-relevant blog posts and articles:
  * [Twitter: Sharing learnings about our image cropping algorithm](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2021/sharing-learnings-about-our-image-cropping-algorithm)
  * [TikTok and the Sorting Hat](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat)
  * [Core Modeling at Instagram](https://instagram-engineering.com/core-modeling-at-instagram-a51e0158aa48)
  * [When We Say 70 Percent, It Really Means 70 Percent](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-we-say-70-percent-it-really-means-70-percent/)
  * [Recent Advances in Google Translate](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html)
  * [Reproducibility in Deep Learning and Smooth Activations](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/reproducibility-in-deep-learning-and.html)
